regresspy is a python module for carrying out simple regressions using gradient descent algorithm. However, the library is half complete. Your task is to fill in the necessary codes. The tasks of the project is given below:

I have Forked the repository from main branch of the file.
New branch created using my username.
Filled .gitignore file by creating one for Python from .gitignore.io.
Write the codes for the mean absolute, sum of squared, mean squared, and root mean squared errors in the loss.py file.
test_loss.py completed.
After that, went to the gradient_descent.py file. It contains two functions named forward for computing forward propagation and backward for computing the gradients. The second one was already done. All I have filled in the codes for forward propagation.
Then went to the main.py file where the actual training will take place. The first task was to complete the _initialize_weights function. Then completed the _train function. Finally, completed the predict and score function.
then went to the model.py file in the test folder. There, I have performed two regressions. First one was carried out using the SGDRegressor from the sklearn library. Second one was carried out using my own codes. Compared the results and wrote in the README.md file (You can delete this README file).
Filled requirements.txt file according to the libraries I have used in my codes.
Filled the setup.py file to install the code as a library.
